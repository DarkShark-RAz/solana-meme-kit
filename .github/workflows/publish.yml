      # Build if necessary (tsc), but for now we publish ts directly or we should add a build step?
      # Usually we publish compiled JS + .d.ts.
      # Let's add a build script to package.json to be safe, but for now we just publish.
      # If we publish TS, users need to compile it. Standard is to publish JS.
      # Let's assume we publish as is for specific TS/Bun consumers OR add a build step.
      # For a "kit" like this, pre-compiling is better. I'll add a build step next.
